highlight as many types of errors as possible, which are commented on by my teacher. The errors that you highlight should not be included in the following list: {{error_types }}. if there is not a single error that does not fit the types in the desired list, return an empty list.at the same time, comments in the types, of course, should overlap, there is no need to invent a new error for each, but it is also necessary to highlight as many as possible. give the answer in a Python list with the names of the error types in English. here are the comments themselves, in json format: {{ dataset }}
