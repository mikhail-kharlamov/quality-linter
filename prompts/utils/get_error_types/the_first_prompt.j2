Objective: Analyze the provided JSON dataset (10 pull requests, including code and comments) and extract a structured list of distinct error types that cover the majority of issues.

Instructions:

Analyze the code changes and comments in the JSON dataset for technical and non-technical issues.
Define a set of error types that broadly categorize these issues (e.g., "Security Vulnerability," "Code Style Violation"). Each type should generalize multiple similar errors.
Output a JSON with the following schema:

{
  "error_types": ["Syntax Error", ...]
}

Prioritize high-impact, recurring patterns over one-off edge cases.

Example output:

{
  "error_types": [
    "Syntax Error",
    "Logic Flaw",
    "Performance Bottleneck",
    "Missing Documentation",
    "Inconsistent Naming",
    "Unhandled Edge Case",
    "Security Vulnerability",
    "Test Coverage Gap",
    "Build Failure",
    "Duplicate Code"
  ]
}
